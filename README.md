## üìò Overview

This repository documents a small but insightful project on **understanding and implementing LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** from scratch.  
It bridges theory and practice by exploring how **low-rank matrix decomposition** can lead to efficient model fine-tuning with minimal parameter updates.

## üß© Implemented Notebooks

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ `svd.ipynb`
- Provides an **intuitive demonstration of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**.  
- Shows how a low-rank approximation can represent nearly the same information as a full-rank matrix, but with **much fewer parameters**.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ `lora_from_scratch.ipynb`
- Implements **LoRA applied to a fully connected (Linear) layer** in PyTorch.  
- Demonstrates that fine-tuning only a small number of low-rank parameters can **improve recognition accuracy on the digit ‚Äò9‚Äô**, compared to full-parameter training.  
- Includes visualization and comparison of performance between the **base model** and the **LoRA-augmented model**.

## üß† Key Learnings

- Gained a deeper understanding of **low-rank decomposition** as the mathematical foundation of LoRA.  
- Learned how to use **`torch.nn.utils.parametrize`** to dynamically modify model parameters ‚Äî enabling **external parameter injection or transformations**  
  without altering the model‚Äôs original architecture (`__init__` and `forward`).  
- Experienced how **parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)** techniques can achieve meaningful improvements with minimal additional compute.
